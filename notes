Cucumber Class 1:

To achieve proper reporting, I need cucumber to reuse the code and save time on scripting, executing the piece of code that we want.  Easily readable test cases in Cucumber

Maven
Pom.xml file – it is the backbone of our Maven project
Scr – under this, we have the main and test folders
Main – where we write the code to develop the application
Test – where we write the code to test the application

Under Test
Java – for all java stuff
Resources – for all non java stuff

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User story - Login functionality

user story - search employee

Search employee by id
Search employee by name

Rules of background -
til the time flow is not broken in all the scenarios of one feature file, we can keep steps under background
background is applicable for only one feature file, it means for every feature file, background will be different
background will be executed before every single scenario of that feature file

hooks - we keep pre conditions and post conditions for the whole project for all scenarios in it
hooks must be placed under steps package

Order of execution
hooks -> background -> scenario -> hooks
