Cucumber Class 1:

To achieve proper reporting, I need cucumber to reuse the code and save time on scripting, executing the piece of code that we want.  Easily readable test cases in Cucumber

Maven
Pom.xml file – it is the backbone of our Maven project
Scr – under this, we have the main and test folders
Main – where we write the code to develop the application
Test – where we write the code to test the application

Under Test
Java – for all java stuff
Resources – for all non java stuff
